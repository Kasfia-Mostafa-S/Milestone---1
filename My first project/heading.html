<p>Web browsers receive <small>HTML</small> documents from a <small>web server</small> or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance</p>

<p>The HyperText Markup Language or <b>HTML</b> is the <em>standard markup language</em> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
